    "You" "I get that you're like playing with me or something.."
    "You" "But I don't know at what point you will grow sick of it."
    "You" "So can you decide soon?"
    "You" "Because I don't think the stress of a 7 foot monster in my closet, is good for my health."
    "You" "So feel free to kill me or move on."
    "It" "An interesting response."

    "You" "Pardon."

    "It" "Why do you eat chicken or pig?"
    "You" "...Cause I need to eat?"
    "It" "..Hm and you can easily get that protein from plants."
    "You" "I mean...maybe but."
    "It" "Well that's why."
